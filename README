This is a gimp script and some supporting programs to generate an X background
image reflecting the current weather.  It's not very well packaged at the
moment, so it takes a little to set up.  It works on Linux and FreeBSD, but you
can probably get it to run on any *nix.

Requirements:
 - gimp 2.2
 - gcc
 - fvwm-root, xv, or other program to set the X root image
 - perl with modules:
   - URI
   - LWP
   - XML::XPath

Instructions:
 - Run make.  It should build sunpos and install prism.ggr in
   ~/.gimp-2.2/gradients.
 - Edit xbg.sh and set w, h, and displays to the width, height, and X11
   display(s).  (Multi-headed displays are assumed to be homogeneous.)  Set
   setroot to a program that can display an xpm on root.
 - Create /etc/geopos or ~/.geopos with a single line containing your latitude
   and longitude.  E.g.: "40.7 -73.9".  (You can get this from google maps if
   you don't know them.)
 - Run ./xbg.sh.  If you just want to play, you can run ./xbg.sh -e to open the
   image in gimp.
